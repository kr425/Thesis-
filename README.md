Masters Thesis for Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. Full Developement of a health watch, which includes hardware and software design. The watch records Heart Rate, Heart Rate Variability, Respiration Rate and multiple HRV metrics for links to stress. The signals robustness is kept through multiple predictive algorithms to remove undesired motion artefacts.
